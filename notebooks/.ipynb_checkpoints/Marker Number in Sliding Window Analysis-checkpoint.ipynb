    "Although the function for sliding window analysis is fantastic, it will calculate an average even if there is only 1 marker in the window. Since this isn't really an average, I want to remove these positions from the plotting input. In order to do that, I must go through the sliding window analysis output and put \"NA\" in any row which has fewer than 2 markers contributing to the average. \n",
