    "## Size & Frequency of Genomic Islands\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to calculate how the size and frequency of genomic islands changes throughout my three comparisons: within-East, within-West, and East v. West. Although this is specifically focused on genomic islands of divergence, since I have the data, I'll be looking at regions with significant evidence of balancing selection as well. \n",

    "This was very low tech - I used a combination of the [plots](https://github.com/mfisher5/PCod-Compare-repo/tree/master/analyses/SlidingWindow/plots) and the output from [Marker Function in Sliding Window Analysis](https://github.com/mfisher5/PCod-Compare-repo/blob/master/notebooks/Marker%20Function%20in%20Sliding%20Window%20Analysis.ipynb), which gave me a data frame of all windows that were above or below the 95% confidence interval. \n",
