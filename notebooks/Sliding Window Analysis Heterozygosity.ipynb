    "I need to conduct a sliding window analysis on per-locus heterozygosity in the eastern Pacific and western Pacific populations of cod. \n",

    "### 1. Calculate per-locus heterozygosity\n",
    "\n",
    "I used `adegenet` to load my genepop file into R as a `genind` object, and then used `hierfstat` to calculate per locus heterozygosity for the eastern and western populations individually, with the `basic.stats` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "I then manipulated the data frame so that I had an output file with two columns: the locus name, and the observed heterozygosity\n",
