    "## Compare Sliding Window Analyses\n",

    "\n",
    "I want to be able to compare interesting regions identified in sliding window analysis between groups - east v. west, east, west. \"Interesting regions\" would be those in which the sliding average Fst goes above or below the 95% confidence interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote an R function that will take the output files from two separate sliding window analyses, and then plot the results by chromosome as stacked plots. I then indicated regions under selection with dotted lines, which can be aligned across plots. \n",
